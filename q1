Here’s a **polished answer** using the **STAR method** that reflects the key principles.

### **Situation**  
In my role as Principal Engineer for Developer Productivity, I was tasked with creating an actionable view of **DORA metrics**—Lead Time for Change, Deployment Frequency, Change Failure Rate, and MTTR. The objective was to use these metrics to **drive engineering efficiency** and align with business objectives. This project was critical to our organization's delivery transformation, and I worked directly with the **CTO** to ensure its success. The **tight deadline** added complexity, requiring coordination across multiple teams, including DevOps, SRE, technology reporting, and TREM teams.

### **Task**  
The task was to **build and consolidate DORA metrics** from different data sources into a single dashboard, providing meaningful insights. A critical challenge was sourcing accurate data—especially **MTTR**—from both the **technology reporting** team and the **TREM (Technology Risk and Event Management)** team. Additionally, I had to align stakeholders across **engineering, operations, and leadership**, ensuring smooth collaboration to meet the deadline.

### **Action**  
1. **Force Multiplier**:  
   - I identified **champions** within each team—DevOps, SRE, and TREM—who could drive specific tasks. This allowed faster execution and minimized bottlenecks.  
   - I set clear objectives aligned with the **CTO’s expectations**, which gave the project visibility and helped secure stakeholder support.  

2. **Execution and Delivery**:  
   - I implemented a **two-phase delivery approach**—first building dashboards for metrics with readily available data (Deployment Frequency, Lead Time for Change) and later integrating more complex metrics like **MTTR** and **Change Failure Rate**.  
   - To manage dependencies, I facilitated **daily stand-ups** across teams and ensured **real-time updates** via shared progress trackers.  

3. **Technical Acumen**:  
   - I designed **automated data pipelines** to collect, aggregate, and visualize the metrics using tools like **Elastic and Grafana**, ensuring data reliability.  
   - I created custom scripts to validate MTTR data from both the **reporting and TREM teams**. 

4. **Continuous Learning & Growth**:  
   - I ran **training sessions** on the meaning and impact of DORA metrics to help stakeholders understand the value of these insights.  
   - The **playbooks** we developed during this project were later shared across teams to improve future observability efforts.  

5. **Big Picture Thinking**:  
   - I aligned the project with **organizational priorities**, such as improving deployment frequency while reducing operational risks.  
   - I ensured that these metrics would not only track past performance but also provide actionable insights for future improvements.

### **Result**  
- **On-time delivery:** We met the project deadline and provided a single-pane view of the DORA metrics.  
- **Impact on productivity:** Deployment frequency improved by **25%**, and MTTR was reduced by **40%** within the first quarter.  
- **Improved decision-making:** Leadership, including the CTO, gained real-time visibility into engineering performance, helping prioritize future initiatives.  
- **Sustainable impact:** The playbook we developed was adopted across other teams, driving further improvements in **observability and delivery practices**.

This response emphasizes your **leadership, technical skills, and ability to deliver** complex initiatives through cross-functional collaboration. It aligns well with the core principles of **force multiplication, execution, technical acumen, continuous growth, and strategic thinking**.
