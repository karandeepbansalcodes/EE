Here’s a well-structured **STAR response** with a specific focus on **technical acumen**, demonstrating both deep expertise and strategic decision-making to solve a complex challenge.

### **Situation**  
During the final stages of launching **GitLab** as the primary code management platform, we discovered that **code search functionality**—a feature heavily relied upon by developers—was not available. Without it, the **developer experience would suffer**, creating significant friction post-launch. This posed a **critical risk** to the product’s success, and missing the release deadline was not an option. 

---

### **Task**  
The task was to implement **code search functionality** before the go-live date. The solution required setting up an **Elasticsearch cluster** that would efficiently index the code, ensuring **performance, compliance, and co-location** with the GitLab environment. However, building the cluster from scratch would take **at least 30 days**, which exceeded our timeline. I needed to find a way to deliver the solution **without compromising on functionality or performance**.

---

### **Action**  
1. **Technical Acumen**:  
   - I used my deep knowledge of **Elasticsearch** and code indexing to identify the technical requirements—**ensuring data consistency** between the index and GitLab’s documentation, optimizing search queries, and **maintaining performance under load**.  
   - I thoroughly analyzed the **existing code indexing solution** used by the organization, identifying an opportunity to **test Elasticsearch within the legacy tool's environment**. This allowed us to validate the indexing process and ensure it would work without disrupting ongoing operations.  

2. **Adaptation and Problem Solving**:  
   - Instead of waiting for the new cluster to be set up, I initiated **parallel testing** with the existing indexing system. I configured the **Elasticsearch prototype** within this environment to verify that:
     - **Indexes were correctly formatted and consistent** with product documentation.  
     - **Query latency** met GitLab's performance requirements.
     - No **data corruption or failures** occurred during the indexing process.  

3. **Force Multiplier**:  
   - I collaborated closely with **DevOps, platform teams, and Elasticsearch administrators**, aligning everyone on the revised plan. This eliminated blockers by ensuring cross-functional teams were on the same page.  
   - I empowered engineers by sharing **optimized configurations** and **test automation scripts**, reducing their workload and speeding up the testing process.  

4. **Execution and Delivery**:  
   - I created **custom dashboards** to monitor the performance of Elasticsearch during testing, giving us real-time insights and preventing potential bottlenecks.  
   - I ensured the **rollout plan** aligned with compliance policies and co-location requirements, minimizing risks during the final deployment.

### **Result**  
- **On-time delivery**: The GitLab platform launched as scheduled, with the **code search feature fully operational**.  
- **Time savings**: By testing Elasticsearch in the existing toolchain, we **reduced the project timeline by 30 days**.  
- **Enhanced developer experience**: Code search performance exceeded expectations, with **query times reduced by 20%**, leading to smoother adoption by developers.  
- **Sustainable impact**: The testing approach and optimized configurations were documented as **best practices** and reused in subsequent projects, accelerating future Elasticsearch deployments.
